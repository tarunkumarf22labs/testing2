      detail: `Deja View is located within a private gated plantation called Elamala Estates, about 20 minutes from Sulthan Bathery (Sultan’s Battery), one of the large towns in Wayanad District. The common use private road winds its way up to the top of the hill past a parking area used by other villa owners in the estate. Up to two cars can be parked on the driveway of your villa.
      Deja View shares the estate with five other private villas and residences. Guests of Deja View are free to spend time in the immediate environs of our villa, and use the common access road leading to the main gate. However, other private paths leading to other residents’ homes are out of bounds.
      The front of the house facing the forest & valley has steps leading down to a small sit-out besides a man-made fish pond. The pond is unfenced and is deep – precautions to be taken when travelling with young children.
      There is a small rear garden with a BBQ grill. It’s the perfect place for a small evening get together.`,

    {
      heading: "Exteriors",
      detail: `Four entrances to the house . The main entrance is via the central French doors on the main verandah that lead directly into the living room. On the left is a single door which connects the outdoor dining to the kitchen. On the right, are French doors from the verandah into the Master Bedroom. At the rear of the house, another door leads from the back garden into the TV area of the open plan living-dining-entertainment area.
      The piece-de-resistance of Deja View is the Verandah that runs along the length of the house on its eastern side. Built in a plantation style, it has a charming six-seater dining table perfect for sun-lit breakfasts and lazy lunches with stunning forest and valley views. On one side is a day-bed swing and a comfortable rocking chair—both perfectly inviting for a coffee and a good read. Or even better for a snooze.
      At the rear of the house is a raised sit-out with comfortable chairs and views of a lovely plant filled garden and lawn, filled with birdsong. The rear garden has an outdoor grill and makes for a nice evening of drinks and DIY barbecue.`,

      heading: "Interior Spaces",
      detail: `The Living Room has a three seater sofa set and two elegant single chairs. The north wall has a set of three water-colours by Rajeshwar Rao. Elegant art-nouveau lamps from Hyderabad lend a warm glow to the room. The south wall is adorned by a large acrylic painted by the homeowner’s daughter.​
      The 4-seater solid mahogany Dining Table has been designed by a local master furniture-maker. Seating consists of two single-seater teak chairs and a bench seat made of a slice of teakwood resting on a wrought-iron frame. The table has been sandwiched cleverly between two carved wooden pillars, salvaged from a demolished Moplah bungalow in the Malabar. A lovely place to dine or work.
      The Media Nook behind the dining area has comfortable seating with Tata Sky, flatscreen TV with an Amazon firestick and Netflix and other OTT channels built in. All you have to do is login and catch up on your favourite shows. There is a Caravan music dock with Bluetooth connectivity.
      The Kitchen is fully-equipped with a 4-burner gas stove, appliances, refrigerator, microwave, oven, toaster, high grade UV drinking water system and a range of cooking and dining ware.`,

The ensuite bathroom is spacious and luxurious with twin vanities sinks and a separate shower area.​
      The Second Bedroom has a King Bed made from African padauk, wardrobes and seating with storage and a luggage rack. The walls are adorned with art by Prakash Karmarkar and Rajeshwar Rao. The ensuite bathroom is large and with separate shower area, a dressing area, and a single vanity sink. An additional door leads directly to the living room.
      The Loft is located above the TV and dining area and overlooks the living room. The steps are surfaced with upcycled wood and Rajasthani marble inlay. The flooring is all teak and a trundle bed fills one side against the large sloping windows. This is a great space for doing yoga, working, or as a sleeping space for the extra adult or children in your group.`,
