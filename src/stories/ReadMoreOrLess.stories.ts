The villa is part of a private community of six homes, the result of a shared vision of a group of friends to create a utopian world - a return to a remembered past of communal living amongst nature. This ideal is embedded in the design of the home - an open plan layout that brings everyone together and the way that spaces commune with the natural surroundings. From its exterior, this is very much a classical Kerala planter-villa with sloping roofs & Calicut terracotta tiling, a rear sit-out & the piece-de-resistance, a long east-facing verandah with sweeping views of rainforest-clad hills.',
